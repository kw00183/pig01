                <h2>Playing Skunk</h2>

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>Playing Skunk is similar to 2-Dice Pig (ie the rules are the same), except that Skunk is played for
                    five rounds and the player who has the most overall points is the winner. Why five rounds? Because,
                    there are 5 letters in "Skunk"!</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.</li>
                    <li>If a single 1 is rolled (ie rolling a skunk), the player’s turn ends with the loss of the turn
                        total.</li>
                    <li>If two 1s are rolled (ie rolling a double skunk), the player’s turn ends with the loss of the
                        turn total and of the entire score.</li>
                    <li>If the player holds, the player's turn tally is added to the player's overall score, and the
                        opponent's turn begins.</li>
                    <li>The player with the most points after five turns wins.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>The optimal strategy is the same as 2 dice Pig: to roll the dice as long as your temporary sum is
                    less than 15. If you achieve a temporary sum of 15 or higher, you should voluntarily stop, and add
                    your temporary score to your previous recorded score. This will give you a new higher score that
                    will be your starting point on your next turn.</p>
