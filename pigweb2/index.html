                <h2>Welcome to All Things Pig</h2>
                <p>We'll start with an introduction to Pig with some background details, and then expand to include some
                    popular variants and their rules and some successful strategies.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I would like to say that the name Pig originated from ancient Roman times, but it's speculative.
                    Legend has it that Roman soldiers invented the game of craps using the knuckle-bones of a pig as
                    dice and their armor shields as a table, so it would not be out of order to speculate that the name
                    of Pig came from ancient pig bone dice, but it's a stretch.<br><br>

                    Instead, let's focus on the known aspects. The game Pig was first documented in <strong>1945 by John
                        Scarne</strong>, an American magician and author known for his expertise in cards and games
                    involving gambling. John Scarne recommended that players determine the first player by the lowest
                    roll of the die. Scarne also recommended that all players should be allowed an equal number of
                    turns. Thus, after the turn where one player holds with a score ≥ 100, remaining players have the
                    opportunity to exceed that or any higher score attained.<br><br>

                    Pig and its variants belong to a class of dice games called jeopardy dice games, where the dominant
                    decision is whether or not to jeopardize all of one’s turn total by continuing to roll for a
                    potentially better turn total. These types of games can be further subdivided into two main
                    subclasses: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games.<br><br>

                    In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score, while in
                    jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it.
                    Pig is classified as a race game.</p>
