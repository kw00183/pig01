                <h2>Playing Pig - Single Dice</h2>

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>The object of the simple dice game Pig is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Each player is
                    given a turn to repeatedly roll the dice. However, after each successful roll (a roll other than 1),
                    the player has to make a choice to either roll again or hold (not roll).</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>If the player rolls a 1, the player scores nothing that turn (ie loses the current tally for the
                        turn) and the opponent player rolls.</li>
                    <li>If the player rolls a number other than 1, the number is added to the player's current tally
                        (sum of the rolls during the turn) for the turn, and they have the option to continue to roll.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player holds, the player's turn tally is added to the player's overall score, and the
                        opponent's turn begins.</li>
                    <li>The first player to 100 wins.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>The simple tactic to Pig is to view each roll as a bet that a 1 will not be rolled, knowing the odds
                    of such a bet are 1 to 5. Then, the player has to ask how much should you risk versus how much is
                    there to gain. According to <strong>Reiner Knizia in <em>Dice Games Properly
                            Explained</em></strong>, A successful throw
                    produces one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. On average, you will gain four points. If you put 20
                    points at stake this brings the odds to 4 to 20, that is 1 to 5, and makes a fair game. Whenever
                    your accumulated points are less than 20, you should continue throwing, because the odds are in your
                    favor.<br><br>

                    However, he does list an exception to this strategy. Consider the following extreme example. Your
                    opponent has a score of 99 and will likely win in the next turn. You have a score of 78 and a turn
                    total of 20. Do you follow the "hold at 20" policy and end your turn with a score of 98? Why not?
                    Because the probability of winning if you roll once more is higher than the probability of winning
                    if the
                    other player is allowed to roll.</p>
