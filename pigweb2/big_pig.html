                <h2>Playing Big Pig</h2>

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>Big Pig is a variation on playing Pig with 2 dice, there are a few different ways to play:</p><br>
                <ol class="indent">
                    <li>When a player rolls two dice and one of the die is a 1, the player loses the points just for
                        that turn. If the player rolls double 1s, he adds 25 to his score, but must roll again!</li>
                    <li>When a player rolls two dice and one of the die is a 1, he loses the points just for that turn.
                        If he rolls double 1s, he adds 25 to his score. If he rolls any other doubles, he adds a double
                        score to his total. For example, double 3s, would score 12 (because you are doubling 3+3). After
                        rolling a double, player must roll again.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.</li>
                    <li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player’s turn ends with the loss of the turn total.</li>
                    <li>If two 1s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total and it becomes the opponent’s turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total, and
                        the player’s turn continues.</li>
                    <li>Players are permitted the same number of turns. So if the first player scores 100 or more
                        points, the second player must be allowed the opportunity to exceed the first player’s score and
                        win.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>The optimal strategy is the same as 2 dice Pig: to roll the dice as long as your temporary sum is
                    less than 15. If you achieve a temporary sum of 15 or higher, you should voluntarily stop, and add
                    your temporary score to your previous recorded score. This will give you a new higher score that
                    will be your starting point on your next turn.</p>
