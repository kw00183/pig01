I made the assumption that I needed to create an HBox (radioBox) for the radio buttons in the PigPane with a spacing of 20, in order for the radio buttons to layout successfully with a small amount of padding in between. This allowed me to get teh same result as the provided jar file game.

I worked under the assumption that the javadoc comment error for @see in the ComputerPane class would resolve once the AbstractPlayer class was built correctly.
